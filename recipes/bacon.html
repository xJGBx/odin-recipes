    <h3>Description:</h3>
    
    <p>
       Baking bacon at 350 degrees F is the way to get crisp bacon 
       without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get 
       burnt by splatters of grease. It "fries" up flat and doesn't curl, 
       which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT 
       sandwiches much easier. Very nice when feeding a family or crowd.

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 
            10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon from the baking sheet with 
            tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
